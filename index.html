        <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Since I have been very young, I have been taking Piano lessons. Then, I started the Oboe. But, I didn't like all the reeds, so I switched to the French Horn. My instructor also taught me music theory and composition. I recently wrote a piece for my school Wind Ensemble, titled <em>Peaceful Pandemic Project</em>.
            <br>
            <br>
            My first Orchestra was Gemini Youth Orchestra. I performed with the Festival Winds and with the Symphony on French Horn and with the Orchestra on Violin. We performed in local venues plus Lincoln Center. One summer GYO went on a tour of Italy. We performed in Lucca in churches and local venues. I learned about improvisation and Puccini.
            <br>
            <br>
            Then I joined the Children’s Orchestra Society. I won their Concerto Competition playing the Violin. In 2021, I won their Concerto Competition on the French Horn. I attended the Majors Program and performed with Violin, Viola, and French Horn. That summer we went as student ambassadors to China in the "Welcome Back Tour" – honoring the Ma family with the opening of a museum dedicated to their heritage. We performed in the Shanghai Symphony Hall, which has AMAZING acoustics. We participated in a bigger music festival, called Music In the Summer Air (MISA), which had musicians from Budapest, Taiwan, America, and China. I highly enjoyed touring China.

            <br>
            The following year, I joined New York Youth Symphony and performed with them for three years. I played the Violin under the tutelage of Michael Repper. We performed in Carnegie Hall. I also joined the Conducting workshop. One summer we went to Spain, where we performed in a Bull Ring!
            <br>
            <br>
            I learned so much by touring different countries. I became interested in different languages and currently study Italian and Chinese in school.
            <br>
            <br>
            I currently study the French Horn with Erik Ralske and will be attending the Juilliard Pre-College next year.</p>
