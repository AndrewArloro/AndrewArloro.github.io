     <span style="color:#ffffff">
       <p>Since I have been very young, I have been taking piano lessons. Then, I started the oboe. But, I didn’t like all the reeds, so I switched to the French horn. My instructor also taught me music theory and composition. I recently wrote a piece for my school wind ensemble, titled "Peaceful Pandemic Project."
       <br>
       My first orchestra was Gemini Youth Orchestra. I performed with the Festival Winds/Symphony on French Horn and The orchestra on violin. We performed in local venues plus Lincoln Center. One summer GYO went on a tour of Italy. We performed in Lucca in churches and local venues. I learned about improvisation and Puccini.
       <br>
       Then I joined the Children’s Orchestra Society. This year I won their concerto competition on the french horn. I attended the Majors Program and performed with violin, viola, and french horn. That summer we went as student ambassadors to China. The "Welcome Back Tour" – honoring the Ma family with the opening of a museum. We performed in the Shanghai Symphony Hall, which has AMAZING acoustics. We were part of a bigger music festival, called Music In the Summer Air (MISA), which had musicians from Budapest, Taiwan, America, and China. I highly enjoyed touring China.
       <br>
       The following year, I joined New York Youth Symphony and performed with them for three years. I played the violin under the tutelage of Michael Repper. We Performed in Carnegie Hall. I also joined the conducting workshop. One summer we went to Spain, where we performed in a Bull Ring!
       <br>
       I learned so much by touring different countries. I became interested in different languages and currently study Italian and Chinese in school.</p>
