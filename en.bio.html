        <p>Twenty-year-old aspiring hornist Andrew Arloro is pursuing an undergraduate degree in music from The Juilliard School. Studying with principal members of the Metropolitan Opera and the Philadelphia Orchestra, he regularly performs in New York, Italy and China. Having attended acclaimed international music festivals such as the Taipei Music Academy and Festival, Andrew has performed with the Grammy-nominated Park Avenue Chamber Symphony, the Grammy–award-winning New York Youth Symphony and the Juilliard Orchestra. He would like to thank most of all his teacher Erik Ralske for strengthening him on his fundamentals and for his hobbies Ice Skating and Chess for teaching more about music than of all his years of practice and study.</p>
